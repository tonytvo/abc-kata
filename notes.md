- for some reasons, running tests from intellij, skip certain tests even though, it not specified with skips
- trycatch to return error early, but it's kind of like state system
  - once the letter is used with certain blocks, it can check the remaining letters with the remaining blocks
  - as long as there one letter that can't be built/match with anyblock, return error
- state monoid seems to be keep repeating as a way to keep tracking of changing mutable state.
- state interface argument list seems to be switching back and forth, which is weird
